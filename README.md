# Blackjack Game

##  Project Overview
This project is a simple **Blackjack game built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.  
It runs entirely in the browser and simulates basic Blackjack gameplay such as dealing cards, hitting, standing, and determining a winner.

The game focuses on **core logic rather than perfect casino rules**, used as a learning project.

##  Purpose of the Project
The main reason for creating this project was to **learn how JavaScript interacts with HTML and CSS**.

Specifically, this project was used to practice:
- Manipulating the DOM (updating text, hiding/showing buttons)
- Handling user interactions with event listeners
- Using JavaScript logic to control game state
- Connecting JavaScript logic to HTML elements
- Managing basic state like scores, wins, and losses

This project helped bridge the gap between **static web pages** and **interactive applications**.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML** – structure of the game
- **CSS** – basic styling and layout
- **JavaScript** – game logic and interactivity

---

##  How the Game Works
- Click **Start Game** to receive two random cards
- Choose to **Hit** to draw another card or **Stand** to end your turn
- The dealer draws a random total
- The game determines the winner based on Blackjack rules

---

##  What I Learned
- How to use `querySelector` and `getElementById`
- How to update HTML dynamically with JavaScript
- How to handle button clicks with event listeners
- How to manage simple game logic and state
- How JavaScript, HTML, and CSS work together in a real project

---

##  Future Improvements
- Proper card deck 
- Ace logic (1 or 11)
- Dealer hitting rules
- Betting system and balance tracking
- Improved UI and animations ie: showing cards to user and deck animation

---

##  Status
This project is complete as a **learning exercise**, but may be expanded in the future.
